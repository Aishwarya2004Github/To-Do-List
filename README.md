# To-Do-List
A to-do list in Java manages tasks, allowing users to add, view, edit, and delete items. It uses an ArrayList to store tasks and includes methods for task operations. Features can include prioritization, deadlines, and data persistence. This project helps in learning object-oriented programming, collections, and UI design.
